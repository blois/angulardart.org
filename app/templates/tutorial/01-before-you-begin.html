      <p>This tutorial assumes that you have some knowledge of the Dart programming language and development environment. It assumes you have no knowledge of Angular, but that you do know basic HTML and CSS.</p>

      <p>To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a Dart development environment and the tutorial’s sample code.</p>

      <h3 id="get-a-dart-development-environment">Get a Dart development environment</h3>

      <p>The easiest way to get started with AngularDart is to install Dart Editor:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>When you download Dart Editor, you also get the Dart SDK (which includes Dart command-line tools) and Dartium—a build of Chromium with the Dart VM. For more information about Dart tools, see www.dartlang.org/tools/.</p>

      <h3 id="get-the-tutorial-sample-code">Get the tutorial sample code</h3>

      <p>All of the code in this tutorial is visible at https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial. We recommend that you get a local copy, either by cloning the repo or by downloading the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial/archive/master.zip">ZIP file</a>.</p>
