      <h1 id="angulardart-tutorial-creating-a-custom-component">Creating a Custom Component</h1>

      <p>In the last chapter, we created a basic Recipe Book app. In this chapter, we will add to the app by creating a feature that will allow users to rate each recipe.</p>

      <h3 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h3>
      <p>Previously, you learned about how
      Angular implements MVC controllers through controllers.
      In this chapter, we will introduce you to components,
      which are a second way Angular implements MVC controllers.
      When you’re finished, you will understand the similarities and differences
      between controllers and components,
      and you will understand when to use controllers and when to use components.</p>

      <h3 id="running-the-sample-app">Running the sample app</h3>
      <p>The code for this chapter is in the
      <em><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial/tree/master/Chapter_03">Chapter_03</a></em> directory of the
      <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial/archive/master.zip">angular.dart.tutorial download</a>.
      View it in Dart Editor by using <strong>File &gt; Open Existing Folder…</strong>
      to open the <strong>Chapter_03</strong> directory. </p>

      <p>Now run the app.
      In Dart Editor’s Files view, select <strong>Chapter_03/web/index.html</strong>,
      right-click, and choose <strong>Run in Dartium</strong>.</p>

      <p>You’ll notice that the rating,
      which used to be displayed as a boring number,
      has now become a not-so-boring cluster of stars.
      Play around with the star ratings by
      changing the rating on each recipe.
      Click any of the recipes to display its details,
      and notice there is also a star rating component in the recipe details section.
      Change the recipe rating in the details section;
      the rating in the recipe list section also changes.</p>

    -->

      <h3 id="angular-components">Angular components</h3>
      <p>The rating feature is an Angular component,
      implemented using the
      <a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/view/Dart/job/angular.dart-master/javadoc/angular.core/NgComponent.html">NgComponent</a> annotation.
      Components are lightweight, reusable, self-contained UI components
      that have a single specific purpose.
      The rating component is a great example of a
      small, simple, re-usable component.
      It can be used anywhere in your app as many times as you want.
      Nothing about the rating component is intrinsically tied to our Recipe Book.
      We could use this component in any app to rate anything.</p>

      <h4 id="using-components-from-your-app">Using components from your app</h4>
      <p>Using a component from your app is simple.
      Just create an HTML element with the name of the component,
      and pass any required properties in as HTML attributes.
      Here is how our Recipe Book app uses the rating component.</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint">
        &lt;rating max-rating="5" rating="ctrl.selectedRecipe.rating"&gt;&lt;/rating&gt;
      </pre>

      <h4 id="creating-components">Creating components</h4>
      <p>Creating a component is similar to creating a controller.
        To create a component, simply create a class and
        add the <code>NgComponent</code> annotation.
        Here is the annotation for our rating component:</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint">@NgComponent(
        selector: 'rating',
        templateUrl: 'packages/angular_dart_demo/rating/rating_component.html',
        cssUrl: 'packages/angular_dart_demo/rating/rating_component.css',
        publishAs: 'cmp'
        )
        class RatingComponent {...}
      </pre>

      <p>Let’s look at those properties in more detail.</p>

      <h5 id="selector"><code>selector</code></h5>
      <p>The <code>selector</code> property of NgComponent serves the same purpose as
      the selector property in a controller.
      It tells Angular which CSS selector should trigger the component.
      By convention, selectors for components are element names, not attributes
      (notice the lack of [] chars around the selector).
      This is because you can only specify one component on any html element.
      By contrast, you can specify more than one controller on an element.</p>

      <p>The following code snippet shows the basic differences between
      how controllers and components selectors are declared,
      and how they’re used in the HTML template.</p>

      <!-- PENDING: The following code is a little weird. Make it a table? -->
      <pre class="prettyprint">@NgComponent(
        selector: 'rating',

        &lt;rating&gt;&lt;/rating&gt;

        @NgController(
            selector: '[recipe-book]',

        &lt;div recipe-book&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>

      <h5 id="templateurl-and-cssurl"><code>templateUrl</code> and <code>cssUrl</code></h5>
      <p>Since components are self contained,
      they need to know what HTML template and CSS to use for their view.
      Components do not use the HTML of your app.
      They have their own.</p>

      <h5 id="publishas"><code>publishAs</code></h5>
      <p>The <code>publishAs</code> property serves the same purpose as
      the <code>publishAs</code> property in a controller.
      It defines the name that the view should use to reference the component.
      Note that the <code>publishAs</code> name is only visible to the component’s view,
      not your app’s view.
      Your app has no direct visibility into the internals of the component.</p>

      <p>Let’s look at our component’s HTML template:
      <pre class="prettyprint">
      &lt;span class="stars"
            ng-if="cmp.rating != null"
            ng-repeat="star in cmp.stars"
            ng-click="cmp.handleClick(star)"
            ng-class="cmp.starClass(star)"&gt;
        {{cmp.starChar(star)}}
      &lt;/span&gt;
      </pre>

      <p><code>rating</code> here refers to the properties and methods on a RatingComponent object.</p>

      <p>A few other properties can be set on a component annotation,
        but these are the most important.
        We will cover some of the less common ones in later chapters.</p>

      <h4 id="defining-attributes">Defining attributes</h4>

      <p>Recall how our Recipe Book app uses the rating component:</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint">
        &lt;rating max-rating="5" rating="ctrl.selectedRecipe.rating"&gt;&lt;/rating&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>To specify which HTML attributes correspond to which properties
        of the component,
        the RatingComponent class uses annotations like the following:</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint">@NgTwoWay(‘rating’)
        int rating;

        @NgAttr('max-rating')
        set maxRating(String value) {...}
      </pre>

      <p>The argument to the annotation
        specifies the HTML attribute name—for example,
        “rating” or “max-rating”.
        Following HTML rules, the attribute name is case insensitive,
        with dashes to separate words.</p>

      <p>Which annotation you should use depends on how you want the attribute
        to be evaluated:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/view/Dart/job/angular.dart-master/javadoc/angular.core/NgAttr.html">NgAttr</a> </dt>
          <dd><p>
            Sets the property to the value of the attribute,
            interpolating if it contains {{}} .
            Our example had this: <code>max-rating="5"</code>.
            You could also get the value from the controller by doing something like
           <code>max-rating="{{ctrl.someProperty}}"</code>.</p>

            <p>
              NgAttr attributes are unidirectional.
              A copy of the attribute is passed to the component,
              and each instance of the component has its own copy.
              The component can change its local value of the property
              without changing the value outside the component.
            </p>
          </dd>

        <dt> <a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/view/Dart/job/angular.dart-master/javadoc/angular.core/NgOneWay.html">NgOneWay</a> </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Evaluates the attribute's value as an expression
            and passes the result to the component.
            You can use any valid expression—for example,
            <code>"foo + bar"</code> would
            pass the result of <code>foo + bar</code> to the component.
          </p>

          <p>
            NgOneWay attributes are unidirectional.
            The component's property changes if the expression's value changes,
            but changing the component's property has
            no effect outside the component.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt> <a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/view/Dart/job/angular.dart-master/javadoc/angular.core/NgTwoWay.html">NgTwoWay</a> </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Evaluates the expression, passes the result to the component,
            and keeps the expression and property value in sync.
            Our example set an NgTwoWay attribute using this code:
            <code>rating="ctrl.selectedRecipe.rating"</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            NgTwoWay is bidirectional.
            When a component changes the value of an NgTwoWay-annotated property,
            the value outside of the component changes, as well.
            In this way, components can change model objects in your app.
            In our example, the rating component changes the rating on
            your RecipeBook’s model objects.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h4 id="how-is-a-component-different-from-a-controller">How is a component different from a controller?</h4>

      <p>The key difference between components and controllers is that
        the inner structure of components are isolated from their surroundings and
        can be thought of as black boxes.</p>

      <p>Components create their own scope hierarchy that is
        invisible from the outside world.
        They don’t have direct access to the app’s scope,
        nor does the app have direct access to a component’s scope.</p>

      <p>Components isolate their views from their surroundings by creating a
        <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fshadow-dom%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF9dpDWirbbvI2JasCRd9Qs1jUg9A">shadow DOM</a>.
        Using a shadow DOM allows components to be used anywhere without
        suffering from things like CSS name collisions.</p>

      <h3 id="angular-features">Angular features</h3>
      <p>This chapter introduced you to two more built in Angular directives:
        <code>ng-if</code> and <code>ng-class</code>.</p>

      <h4 id="ng-ifhttpciangularjsorgviewdartjobangulardart-masterjavadocangulardirectivengifdirectivehtml"><a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/view/Dart/job/angular.dart-master/javadoc/angular.directive/NgIfDirective.html"><code>ng-if</code></a></h4>
      <p>The <code>ng-if</code> directive allows you to
        evaluate sections of the DOM conditionally.
        The <code>ng-if</code> directive takes an expression.
        If the expression is false,
        then the portion of the DOM underneath the if is removed.
        <code>ng-if</code> does not change the visibility of the DOM element.
        It removes it.</p>

      <h4 id="ng-classhttpciangularjsorgviewdartjobangulardart-masterjavadocangulardirectivengclassdirectivehtml"><a href="http://ci.angularjs.org/view/Dart/job/angular.dart-master/javadoc/angular.directive/NgClassDirective.html"><code>ng-class</code></a></h4>

      <p>The <code>ng-class</code> directive allows you to set CSS classes on
        an element dynamically using an expression that
        evaluates to the classes to be added.</p>
